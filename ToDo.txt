ToDo for DungeonDelveXL
-----------------------


-----------
Working Set

Check crash on O365 somehow?

Make the font type user-changeable

Try Dan's tip : selection.numberformat="0.000000"

-----------------
Done This Version

Updated internal data to make it easier to edit and load.
Fixed an issue with loading of static data with some international settings.
Fixed an issue that caused mission goal details to vanish in some circumstances.

Backlog
-------

Add enchanting as a skill?? (Jewels as materials)

Toolbox keeps popping up? -> Go to edit control, open toolbox, close toolbox, save, retry :)
- Alternatively, replicate what makes it popup (e.g. close tab) and then close it, resave, retry

Controlled creatures
- They don't always seem to attack when there's a nearby enemy
-- If no target then always attack target of summoner
- They only attack TLC of size 2,3 creatures : should attack them anywhere
-- That goes for all creatures - always aim for nearest flanking square

Add potions & brewing

Optimise everything (using Dan's utility??)
- Especially AI update, loading & displaying maps/towns

Action buttons on mission control:
- Always have 2 buttons, and they can be set to whatever you want.
-- E.g. set to a weapon, skill, spell (or nothing)
- Arrow keys = move and 7,9,1,3,5 on numeric keypad do the other MissionControl actions as fits their location
- ?? http://www.codeguru.com/vb/gen/vb_system/keyboard/article.php/c4829/Managing-LowLevel-Keyboard-Hooks-with-the-Windows-API.htm

Add an option to stop showing the MsgBox for creature attacks
- Add a "Commentary" window that lists everything that happens

Make item tip windows into modeless dialogs?  [CHECK ModelessMsg - seemed to cause issues]

Ctrl-H (or whatever) hides game and replaces it with a boring spreadsheet

Implement multiple locked doors per level if sufficiently large
- Maybe do it iteratively on top of existing locked door code
-- Alternatively, could look for areas which can be sealed off using two doors?

Hidden Sheets
- Use xlWellHidden to hide templates/data completely from the user?

Add ByVals everywhere

Allow crafting an item even if the inventory will only have sufficient space after crafting materials used up
- Or if the target can fit in a stack?

Are secondary materials cosmetic, or should they give bonuses (other than weight, cost)?

Saving in compatibility mode? (Save everything, don't rely on rnd())


-------------
Stuff To Test
-------------

Possibly doesn't correctly set up party stats if two characters die in the same turn.

Enemy magic users should only summon max one creature

When attempting to learn spells, if character has reached max, still let them improve ones they already have
